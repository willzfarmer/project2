\section{Compression}
Given that we know the special properties of our Discrete Sine Transform and the algorithm behind it, we also know the to undo it, the same method is used. This is a symmetric algorithm that works the same forwards as backwards. Therefore to compress an image we can apply the algorithm one way, delete the extraneous information, and then apply the same algorithm again to revert it back to a readable image.
