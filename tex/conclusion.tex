\section{Conclusion}
Since digital images are represented as three dimensional matrices, image manipulation involves matrix operations. By using matrix multiplication, transpose, and the Discreet Sine Transformation (DST), we were able to translate, rotate, and compress multiple sized images. These analyses prove the usefulness of matrices when working with large sets of finite data, and they merely serve as an introduction to the powerful information processing that these tools provide.
