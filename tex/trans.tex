\section{Transposition}

It is simple to visualize the effect of transposing a matrix; it would be a
rotation about the main diagonal. The resulting image will be rotated
$90^\circ$. Taking the transpose again would give the original image orientation
following the properties of transposed matrices:
\[
A=(A^T)^T
\]

The effect can be seen in Figure~\ref{tr}:
