\section{Inversion}

In order to flip a matrix upside down, we first had to generate an identity
matrix of the appropriate size where the rows had the opposite diagonal
direction.

\[
  \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1&0&0\\
      0&1&0\\
      0&0&1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
  }_{\text{Identity Matrix}}
  \implies
  \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0&0&1\\
      0&1&0\\
      1&0&0\\
    \end{bmatrix}
  }_{\text{Transformation
  Matrix}}
\]
This was done by setting up the identity matrix as a two dimensional array; in
other words, a list of lists. Then this list was iterated through and each list
in the main list was flipped front-to-back. This action had the same effect as
flipping the entire matrix on the horizontal axis. Finally, as before with the
shifting process, we multiplied the matrix on the appropriate side of the
matrix.
\[ 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0&0&1\\
    0&1&0\\
    1&0&0\\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a&b&c\\
    d&e&f\\
    g&h&i\\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    g&h&i\\
    d&e&f\\
    a&b&c\\
  \end{bmatrix}
  }_{\text{The
  inverted  
  matrix}}
\]
